<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
In this project, we investigated Marketing Data to analyze a marketing campaign. The
dataset includes a variety of information about customers like education, income, marital status,
children, amount of money spent on different products, and customers’ responses on campaigns.
Also, the data shows us how customers have done their purchases through different means. The
dataset includes 2,240 samples of customers behaviors in the last 2 years that have been featured
by 28 variables. In this project, by analyzing customers’ behaviors in the past, we want to see
whether they will respond to a future marketing campaign.
